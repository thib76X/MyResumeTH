You must run:
  -npm install formik (form)
  -npm install yup (validation form)
  -npm install @material-ui/core (ui)
  -npm install @material-ui/icons (ui)
  -npm install redux (general store)
  -npm install react-redux (general store)
  -npm install redux-thunk (general store)
  -npm install redux-saga (general store)
  -npm install axios (make some call)
  
I use different tools to show you that i'm able to search and use them.
I didn't proptype everywhere because i got something else to do. 
But don't worry if i do something seriously, i will pay attention to this for future users of my components or myself.

PS: i use "openweathermap" for my call
