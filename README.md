# MyResumeTH
Here you can find different examples of IT languages (WebLanguages) and how I structure them (folder structure in REACT, CSS, PHP, etc). I did not put the extension (CSS) for navigators other than Chrome. So please open them in Chrome.**

PS: 
I don't put everything on GitHub; pure JS projects are old ones.

You may find interesting READMEs in different folders. Nevertheless, some READMEs are empty but you will recognize them because generally their names are "file".
